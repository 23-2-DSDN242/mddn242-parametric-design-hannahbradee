## MDDN 242 2023 Assignment 2

My alphabet is called "Mesh To Z" I was inspired to work with angles and lines when I searched for inspiration on Google Images for geometric fonts. I found that my design looked like mesh so I decided to name it Mesh To Z.
The letters consist of 20 parameters. controlling the background lines, two circles, and two triangles.
below are the parameters used and how they work:

     //ellipses

  "size" controls the width of both circles.
  "offsetx" controls where on the X-axis the first ellipse is.
  "offsety" controls where on the Y axis the first ellipse is.
  "ellipsedistancehor" controls where on the X axis the second ellipse is by adding distance horizontally.
  "ellipsedistancever" controls where on the Y axis the second ellipse is by adding distance vertically. 
  "ellipseheight1" controls the height of the first circle.
  "ellipseheight2"  controls the height of the second circle.
 
  //triangles
  
   "triSize" controls the size of the first triangle
   "triOffsetx" controls the location of the first triangle on the X-axis.
   "triOffsety"  controls the location of the first triangle on the Y axis.
   "triRotation" controls the rotation of the first triangle
   "triSize2" is the only parameter for the second triangle, it controls the size.
   
   //lines
   
      \\ The first set of lines
   "line1startX" controls the start X location.
   "line1startY" controls the start Y location.
   "line1endX" controls the end X location.
   "line1endY" controls the end Y location.
   
      \\ The second set of lines
   "line2startX" controls the start X location.
   "line2startY" controls the start Y location.
   "line2endX" controls the end X location.
   "line2endY" controls the end Y location.

My biggest challenge throughout this assignment would have been trying to limit the amount of parameters I used. I feel I could have easily done it in 12 if I didn't choose to have the background lines as part of my design and had one solid shape with a bold colour that didn't move. However, I wasn't willing to compromise my design as that would have drastically changed the final outcome. 
the next challenge I faced was trying to design the letter S and number 5 to look different from each other and the same with Z and 2. Side by side I feel they still look too similar, but they do have slight differences. 

Overall I am happy with my alphabet. I enjoyed the challenges and using my problem-solving skills to navigate through them. I am looking forward to doing the next assignment.
